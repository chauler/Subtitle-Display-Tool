The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this:

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
