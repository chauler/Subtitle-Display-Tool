# About
Our project is a standalone application that can be included in or called on by other applications to display subtitles. Relevant functionalities of the application include displaying a window, displaying subtitle text, communicating with the host application, accepting multiple subtitle formats, and providing custom API for the host application. 

# Release Notes
